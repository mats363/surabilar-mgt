        <h2>History of MTG</h2>
        <p className="text-magic_regular">
            Somewhere in the early 90s, back when the game was still on the drawing board, creator Richard Garfield wanted to design a Dungeons & Dragons-style game where players are wizards in a fantastical world, but he also wanted the games to be quick and never require anything more than a deck of cards. That’s why the first-ever set, now known as Alpha, was made.
            Back then, the cards didn’t need to be anything more than 
            generic monsters and vague magical artifacts for the game to work. But Garfield left just the hint of a larger world and an epic story, and thus gave birth to one of gaming’s most beloved universes. A multiverse, actually.
